### Description

All the data in the app is mocked. Modularity, reusability, functionality - everything could be improved forever nonstop, but everything is done per requirements. For example, "Checkbox" component could have "size" property for different use cases. But in this particular app, it's been used only once with predefined sizes. That's why there's no need for additional properties/functionality if it's not gonna be used.
